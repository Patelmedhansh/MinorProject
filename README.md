 CI/CD Pipeline with Slack Bot Integration

 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline integrated with a Slack notification bot. The purpose is to automate the deployment process and enhance team communication by sending real-time notifications to a Slack channel.

 Features
- Automated deployment workflow using GitHub Actions.
- Integration of a Slack bot to notify deployment status and errors.
- Cloning and testing of a website (Sundown Studios clone) using the CI/CD pipeline.
- Containerization of the application using Docker.

Technologies Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Used for setting up and managing the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Slack API**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for sending deployment notifications.
- **Sundown Studios Clone**: A sample website used for testing the deployment workflow.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application and managing development environments.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally or integrate it into your own repository:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ci-cd-slack-bot.git
   cd ci-cd-slack-bot
   ```

2. Configuration:
   - Modify the GitHub Actions workflow (`./github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) to suit your deployment requirements.
   - Set up a Slack app and obtain an API token for sending messages.

3. Environment Variables:
   - Define the necessary environment variables in GitHub Secrets or directly in the workflow file.

4. Testing:
   - Make changes to the project code (e.g., `src/index.html`, `src/styles.css`) to trigger deployments.
   - Check the Slack channel for deployment notifications.

 Deployment Workflow
1. Code Changes:
   Push changes to the `main` branch of the repository.

2. GitHub Actions:
   GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the CI/CD workflow defined in `ci-cd.yml`.

3. Slack Notifications:
   The Slack bot integrated with GitHub Actions will send notifications about deployment status.

 Docker
- Dockerfile: Use the provided Dockerfile to build a Docker image of the application.
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-app .
   docker run -p 8080:80 my-app
   ```
